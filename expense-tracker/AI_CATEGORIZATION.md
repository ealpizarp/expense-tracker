# AI-Powered Expense Categorization

This document explains the AI-powered categorization system that intelligently categorizes expenses using Google's Gemini API.

## üß† How AI Categorization Works

### 1. **Input Analysis**

The AI system analyzes multiple data points for each expense:

- **Merchant Name**: "SHELL GAS STATION", "AMAZON.COM", "MCDONALD'S"
- **Description**: Full expense description and context
- **Amount**: Transaction amount for context
- **Location**: Geographic location if available
- **Email Content**: Full email text for additional context

### 2. **AI Processing**

The system sends a detailed prompt to Google's Gemini API that includes:

- All expense details
- Available categories list
- Instructions for categorization
- Examples of good categorizations
- Request for confidence scoring and reasoning

### 3. **Response Parsing**

The AI returns a structured JSON response with:

- **Category**: Primary category assignment
- **Confidence**: 0-100 confidence score
- **Reasoning**: Explanation for the categorization
- **Subcategory**: Optional more specific classification

## üìä Available Categories

The AI can categorize expenses into these 15 categories:

| Category              | Examples                          | Subcategories                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Groceries**         | Walmart, Target, Supermarket      | Supermarket, Convenience Store     |
| **Transportation**    | Shell, Exxon, Gas Station         | Gas Station, Public Transit        |
| **Food & Dining**     | McDonald's, Starbucks, Restaurant | Fast Food, Coffee Shop, Restaurant |
| **Shopping**          | Amazon, Online Store              | Online Retail, Department Store    |
| **Utilities**         | Electric Company, Water Dept      | Electricity, Water, Internet       |
| **Healthcare**        | CVS, Walgreens, Medical           | Pharmacy, Doctor, Hospital         |
| **Entertainment**     | Netflix, Movie Theater            | Streaming, Movies, Games           |
| **Education**         | University, School, Course        | Tuition, Books, Supplies           |
| **Insurance**         | Auto Insurance, Health Insurance  | Auto, Health, Life                 |
| **Travel**            | Hotel, Airline, Car Rental        | Hotel, Flight, Rental Car          |
| **Home & Garden**     | Home Depot, Lowe's                | Hardware, Garden, Furniture        |
| **Personal Care**     | Salon, Gym, Spa                   | Beauty, Fitness, Wellness          |
| **Business**          | Office Supplies, Business Service | Supplies, Services, Software       |
| **Gifts & Donations** | Charity, Gift Shop                | Charity, Gifts, Donations          |
| **Other**             | Unclear or unique expenses        | Uncategorized                      |

## üéØ AI Categorization Features

### **Smart Context Analysis**

- Analyzes merchant names, descriptions, and email content
- Considers amount and location for additional context
- Uses natural language understanding for better accuracy

### **Confidence Scoring**

- **High Confidence (80-100%)**: Clear category match
- **Medium Confidence (60-79%)**: Likely category with some uncertainty
- **Low Confidence (0-59%)**: Uncertain categorization

### **Reasoning Transparency**

- Provides explanations for each categorization decision
- Helps users understand why expenses were categorized
- Enables manual review and correction when needed

### **Subcategory Detection**

- Automatically suggests more specific classifications
- Helps with detailed expense tracking and analysis
- Examples: "Gas Station" for Transportation, "Fast Food" for Food & Dining

## üîÑ Fallback System

If AI categorization fails, the system automatically falls back to rule-based categorization:

1. **API Error**: Network issues, rate limits, or API failures
2. **Invalid Response**: Malformed or unexpected AI response
3. **Timeout**: Request takes too long to process

The fallback system uses keyword matching similar to the original system but with enhanced patterns.

## üìà Performance Metrics

### **Batch Processing**

- Processes expenses in batches of 5 to avoid rate limits
- Includes delays between batches for API respect
- Handles individual failures gracefully

### **Rate Limiting**

- Respects Google Gemini API rate limits
- Implements exponential backoff for retries
- Monitors API usage and adjusts accordingly

### **Error Handling**

- Graceful degradation to fallback system
- Detailed error logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# Required for AI categorization
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
```

### **API Configuration**

- **Model**: `gemini-pro` (latest stable model)
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low for consistent categorization)
- **Max Tokens**: 200 (sufficient for categorization response)
- **Top P**: 0.8 (balanced creativity and consistency)

## üìä Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Gas Station**

```json
{
  "merchant": "SHELL GAS STATION",
  "description": "Transaction Alert - $45.67 at SHELL GAS STATION",
  "amount": 45.67,
  "location": "San Jose, CA"
}
```

**AI Response:**

```json
{
  "category": "Transportation",
  "confidence": 95,
  "reasoning": "Merchant name clearly indicates a gas station, which is a transportation expense",
  "subcategory": "Gas Station"
}
```

### **Example 2: Online Shopping**

```json
{
  "merchant": "AMAZON.COM",
  "description": "Your order has been processed - $89.99",
  "amount": 89.99,
  "location": "Online"
}
```

**AI Response:**

```json
{
  "category": "Shopping",
  "confidence": 90,
  "reasoning": "Amazon is a well-known online retailer, clearly indicating a shopping expense",
  "subcategory": "Online Retail"
}
```

### **Example 3: Ambiguous Merchant**

```json
{
  "merchant": "ABC COMPANY",
  "description": "Payment of $150.00 to ABC COMPANY",
  "amount": 150.0,
  "location": "Unknown"
}
```

**AI Response:**

```json
{
  "category": "Other",
  "confidence": 45,
  "reasoning": "Merchant name is too generic to determine specific category without more context",
  "subcategory": "Uncategorized"
}
```
